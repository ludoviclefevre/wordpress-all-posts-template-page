Wordpress all posts template page
=================================

Wordpress template page to list all posts title with a link (like this: http://www.visiterlesusa.com/?page_id=448)

I use it with response theme (http://cyberchimps.com/responsive-theme/) so you may need to edit it to fit your needs.

Installation:

1) Copy the file allposts.php in your theme directory (/wp-content/themes/your-theme/)

2) In wordpress administration, create a new page and select "All posts" in the template dropdown list.
